Python codes:
Used the pandas library for data cleaning.
Checked whether there are any missing values, and obtained the total no. of missing values in the dataset. There was 4307 missing values in the dataset.
Handled the missing values by replacing them with "UNKNOWN" string.
Then, checked for any duplicate rows/cases in the dataset. After checking, it was concluded that, there are no duplicate rows/cases.
All of the columns have been standardised by converting all of them into title cases.
Data have been standardised into the dd-mm-yyyy format.
The column headers have been dispalyed and then renamed such that there are no spaces between them,and all of them are in lowercase.
The datatype of each column have been checked,and they have been fixed.
